# Community Detection

## Overview

Community Detection is a fundamental graph analysis task that involves identifying groups or communities of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the network. These communities represent cohesive subgraphs where nodes within the same community have stronger connections than nodes across different communities.

## Purpose

Community detection aims to:
- **Identify cohesive groups**: Find sets of nodes that form tightly-knit communities
- **Understand network structure**: Reveal the hierarchical organization of networks
- **Discover functional modules**: Identify functional units in biological or social networks

- **Enable targeted interventions**: Identify key communities for targeted actions
